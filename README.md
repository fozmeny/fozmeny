# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello, I am a penetration tester who has dedicated his life to the cyber world. 
Now I want to establish a cyber security platform like Secyber and give the cyber world a more independent and safer internet environment. 
I am here to protect and preserve from censorship, oppression and tyrants like this.
In short, I am the lord of the cyber world.
